## Used contexts

You have to add at least one extra context to your site

- [x] prefers-reduced-motion.
- [x] animations.
- [ ] dark-mode.
- [x] input type (pointer).
- [x] hsl / hsla.
- [x] clip-path / background-clip.

## Restrictions

You have to work with _at least_ two of these restrictions.
For this assignment I have chosen the following two restrictions:

- [x] When SVG meets CSS: Shapes / Masks / SVG
- [ ] Two colours
- [x] Responsive without media queries

## The *Selector First* CSS Methodology

For this assignment I had to work with the so called *Selector First* CSS Methodology. This means that I _had to_ use a wide variety of CSS selectors. ID’s are only allowed to trigger the `:target` selector. If I really needed them, I was allowed to use a few classes. In order to differentiate between.
